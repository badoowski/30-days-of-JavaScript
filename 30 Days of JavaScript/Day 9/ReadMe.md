What was learn from January 28th to 29th 2023:


    A. High Order Function: (i)   Callback functions (What it was and how it is being used).
                            (ii)  Returning functions (high order function that return functions as values)
                            (iii) Callback using forEach() method.
                            

    B. Setting Time:        (i)   Set Interval using setInterval() method
                            (ii)  Set timeout using setTimeout() method

    
    C. Functional Programming:  (i)   forEach() -> it iterate an array and takes a callback function with element, 
                                      index parameter and array.

                                (ii)  map() -> it is used to modify an arrayby iterating the array. it takes a     
                                      callback funtion with element, index parameter and array and returns a new array.
                                
                                (iii) filter() -> it filters out items which satisfied the condition given and 
                                      return a new array.

                                (iv)  reduce() -> it takes a callback function that takes accumalator, current and 
                                      optional initial value as parameters and return a single value.

                                (v)   every() -> it checks if all the elements are similar in one aspect and return 
                                      in boolean.

                                (vi)  find() -> it returns the first element that satisfied the condition given.

                                (vii) findIndex() -> it returns position of the first element that satisfied the 
                                      conditon given.

                               (viii) sort() -> it return in a sorted ascending order.

                                (ix)  some() -> it checks if some elements are similar in one aspect and return in 
                                      boolean.

    D. Sort():  (i)  Sorting Numerical Array -> numericArray.sort((a, b) => a - b)

                (ii) Sorting Object Array -> objArray.sort((a, b) => {
                                                    if(a.key < b.key) return -1
                                                    if(a.key > b.key) return 1
                                                    return o
                                                                     })
