    A. HTML 5 Web Storage:  Web Storage is a new HTML5 API offering important benefits over traditional cookies. Before HTML5, 
                            application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.        
    
    
    B. Web Storage Objects          (i)   localStorage  (it has no expiration time)
                                    (ii)  sessionStorage (it expire when the browser is closed)

    C. localStorage Methods:        (i)   .clear() -> to remove everything in the local storage
                                    (ii)  .setItem() -> to store data in the localStorage. It takes a key and a value parameters.
                                    (iii) .getItem() -> to display data stored in the localStorage. It takes a key as a parameter.
                                    (iv)  .removeItem() -> to remove stored item form a localStorage. It takes key as a parameter.
